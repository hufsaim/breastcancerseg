Automatic cancer segmentation in breast DCE-MRI.

## Data preparation 
Anonymized dicom files were converted to compressed nifti format using [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).
- T1_pre.nii.gz
- T1_post.nii.gz
- T1_post_delayed.nii.gz
  
The side containing cancer and the side without cancer were separately stored.
- cancer/T1_pre.nii.gz, cancer/T1_post.nii.gz, cancer/T1_post_delayed.nii.gz
- contra/T1_pre.nii.gz, contra/T1_post.nii.gz, contra/T1_post_delayed.nii.gz

## Ground truth segmentation
3D ground truth segmentation was generated by following steps:
1. (manual) Two box-shaped ROIs were manually placed on the axial and sagittal maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, respectively.
2. (automatic) 3D ground truth segmentations were automatically generated using the box-shaped ROIs.
3. verification and correction

## Segmentation model
A [3D UNETR model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10504) was trained for automatic cancer segmentation.
